# Stock-Market-Data-Analysis-using-the-Alpha-Vantage-API-
This project involved retrieving, analyzing, and visualizing historical stock market data for major companies like Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) using the Alpha Vantage API. The goal was to gain insights into stock price movements over time and to identify key trends using Python.

# Key Features:
- Automated data extraction of historical stock prices through API integration.
- Visualization of price trends (uptrends, downtrends, and sideways trends) using candlestick charts for insightful decision-making.
- Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib were used for data cleaning, manipulation, and visualization.
- Filter-based dynamic plotting for specific stocks and time periods

# Key Learning Points:

**API Integration**: Mastered the use of APIs (specifically Alpha Vantage) to retrieve large datasets efficiently for financial analysis.
**Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Gained experience in handling and preprocessing financial time series data, ensuring itâ€™s ready for analysis and visualization.
**Candlestick Charting**: Learned how to create and interpret candlestick charts for stock analysis, identifying key market patterns like uptrends and downtrends.
**Data Visualization**: Enhanced skills in Python libraries such as Matplotlib to create dynamic, interactive plots that effectively convey stock price movements.
